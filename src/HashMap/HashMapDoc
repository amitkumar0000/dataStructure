How HashMap Work Internally
----------------------------
Internally HashMap is array of Node.
Class Node {
    int hash;
    K Key;
    V value;
    Node next;
}

Performance of HashMap
====================
Depends upon:- 1. Initial Capacity
               2. Load Factor.
                    Load Factor is a measure when rehashing will happen. Rehashing means increasing the capacity.
                    Its values varies between 0 to 1.

Hashing Get and Put Method
----------------------------
Put method
-----------
  1.Calculate HashCode of Key say 118
  2. Calculate index by index method  e.g  index = hashcode(key) & n-1   n=16   index will be 6
  3.create a node object
  node{
    hashcode = 118
    key
    value
    node next = null
  }
  4. place the node object at index 6 . if no object is present add this.
     if object is present
        check key are same via hashcode and equal method
            if key are same then replace the object value.
            else connect the object as linked list

Get Method
-----------
  1. Calculate hashcode of key. say hashcode 118
  2. Calculate index by index method  e.g index = hashcode(key) & n-1 n=16 index=6
  3. Go to index 6. if key is same return the value.
    else check the next object in linked-list
